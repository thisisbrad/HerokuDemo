# Instructions 
Update this document to summarize integrative research and activity conducted this week. This should include material provided to you in this program in addition to your own independent study.    

**Note:** Be sure to add a research document to your docs folder each week to receive credit for your integrative study time. Replace LastFirst with your own last and first name. The naming convention is "R#-LastFirst.md". Replace the # symbol with the current week number.

## Forms in React
This was a demo on forms from React. It begins by explaining what controlled components are. Controlled components are elements whose value is controlled by React. The demo goes over different input tags such as textarea and select. It then talks about handling multiple inputs. It explains that adding a name attribute to each element allows the handler function to choose what to do based on the value. The demo ends by talking about alternative to controlled components. It suggests reading up on uncontrolled components for implementing input forms.

* Handling multiple inputs 
* Alternatives to Controlled Components

## Example Topic Title
This article was about reducing Redux Reducer logic. It begins by showing how to extract utility function and case reducers. This makes it clearer to see what is going on. The demo then separates data handling by the domain. It splits the filter and todo logic. The article finishes by showing how to combine reducers by slice. 

* Extracting functions and reducers 
* Separating data handling by domain 
* Combining reducers by slice

## Reference Links
Use this section to highlight your own independent research. Replace the example references below with your own links and recommended resources. It is acceptable to provide multiple links for a single topic.  

I found all of the resources I went over this week to be helpful. "Do you need Redux" went over how people jump to Redux before they even know if their app will need it and how you can use Redux techniques without Redux. "Redux Devtools" showed that using the Devtools can provide faster debugging, tracking and working with state. "Why objects are better" goes over how objects are better to store a list. It also discusses how using objects saves lines of code, time, and bugs
