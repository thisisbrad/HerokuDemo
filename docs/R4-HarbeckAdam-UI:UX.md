## Dialog Design
This article discussed the five essential rules for dialog design. Dialogs are also known as pop-up windows and modals. The author talks about how to properly design a dialog. They go over what is too much and how it should simple, clean, and have a clear close option. 

* Designing dialogs properly.
* Striving for minimalism.
* Using the right dialog for the right situation.

## Design Process
This article talks about wireframes in the design process. It delves even deeper than just wireframes to discuss many artefacts and their relevance in the design process, such as sketches, mockups, and screen design.  

* Defining artefacts, naming, and their attributes.
* Aligning artefacts with your process.
* Gain common understanding with your team about artefacts.

I found both Aesthetic-Usability Effect and the 15 rules every UX designer shoudl know to be very helpful. The Aesthetic Usability effect talks about ways to figure out if it actually is the effect or something else. It talks about how to combat this to get to the real usability issue. The 15 Rules really drove the point home that, as designers, we need to separate ourselves and not think that we are the user. It also reaffirmed that using UI patterns that people are ware of is the best thing for UI design.
