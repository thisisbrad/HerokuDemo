## Why you Should Always do Documentation Before Development
The article described why using document driven development is the best thing to do. It talks about how documenting the application before code can help find issues with logic, space, and more. It discusses how it is better to document first as it becomes a blueprint for the code. It also makes the code more consistent.

## Reference Links
Use this section to highlight your own independent research. Replace the example references below with your own links and recommended resources. It is acceptable to provide multiple links for a single topic.  

The resources I found most useful were the Document-driven Development and Atomic Design articles. The document-driven development article provides more detail about the process. It also describes how documentation guarantees the goals of the program are well documented. Atomic Design is something I have heard about before but this was a nice refresher of what it actually was. It provided more examples and a breakdown of each component.
