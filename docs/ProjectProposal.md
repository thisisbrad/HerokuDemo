# It's a Batter Day

## Application Definition Statement

*A* *clear* *high-level summary should be used to introduce the concept. This should be similar to an elevator pitch or a conversational reply to* *"What* *are you building**?”.* *You will e**xplore the audience and their demographics, the problem they are having, and your solution in subsequent sections in more detail but touch on them here.* 

*Clarity over quantity should be the focus, to that end, creating visuals/charts to explain the more complex data or logical points could help to reinforce your Application’s Definition Statement.*

It’s a Batter Day makes fresh dough and batter that is then delivered to the customer. Customers then bake the dough or batter, giving them that fresh-from-the-oven taste. This eliminates the headache of looking for recipes, the time it takes to make the mixture, and the cost of buying the ingredients and tools. This is especially true for gluten free, dairy free, and vegan goods. 

It’s a Batter Day targets single and married women from the ages of 24 to 58 of all races that live in, or close to, a city. These women have a lot going on, be it children or work, and they don’t have the time or energy to bake. With our service, they just bake the item, which can be done at their convenience.  

## Target Market

What are their ages, education level, employment sector, income level, hobbies, or any other defining characteristics that set them apart from other groups of people? Identifying specific groups will help drive application design choices.*

## Use Cases

*Defining a typical use case or scenario that a user would be interacting with your application provides a fixed path of interaction that you can refine your user’s experience around. If a user wants to listen to some music during a workout does requiring them to clicking 10+ times make sense while they are impatiently trying to start their exercise regimen? Use cases help to think through how your application will commonly be used.*

*Use Cases will help to drive design decisions as well as testing procedures. Regularly testing as if you were a user following a use case throughout the project development lifecycle will provide valuable insight into how your application is addressing the needs of the user and allow you to correct missteps early.*

Use Case 1:

A customer forgets to make a cake for her brother's birthday party, which is less than an hour and a half away. She goes to the website, clicks the menu button, then clicks on cakes. She scrolls until she finds one that she likes and clicks the add to cart button. She clicks on the cart button and then the checkout button. She enters her information then clicks the purchase button.

Use Case 2: 

A customer is supposed to make something for a bake sale but, this is a free from bake sale. She has never made anything free from before and all the recipes call for a lot of ingredients that aren’t cheap. She goes to our website and sees the free from category on the homepage. She clicks on the category and is taken to the Free From Order page. She filters for cupcakes and then clicks on the one she likes. She reads about the bake time and then clicks on the add to cart button. She clicks on the cart button and then clicks the checkout button. She enters her information and then clicks on the complete purchase button. 

Use Case 3: 

A customer is exhausted when they get off work and nothing sounds better to them than a fresh and warm muffin. They don’t have the energy to make a whole batch of muffins, and it is too late in the day for any place to have fresh muffins. She goes to the website and scrolls the homepage. She sees the blueberry banana and bourbon muffins in the best sellers. She clicks the add to cart button, and then the cart button. From the cart she clicks the checkout button, enters her information, and clicks the complete purchase button. 

## Problem Statement

*In a few sentences explain the problem your target market is seeing that requires this project to be built. This will identify why is your application needed and needs to be supported by Primary Research.*

The target market is seeing problems with time, energy, resources, and ability. Dealing with work, school, children, or any combination of the three can leave a person with very little time and energy. They don’t have enough time or energy to stand over a bowl and make something. Baking is also not the easiest or cheapest thing. Free from goods for example require higher end ingredients meaning more cost and less reward as those ingredients usually don’t come in large amounts. It is also easy to misread or add the wrong ingredient, which completely changes the result. 

## Pain Points

*Explain your audience’s pain points that are contributing to their defined problem and their impact on the user. Primary Research should support your explanations.*

The pain points that are contributing to the problem are not enough time or energy in the day due to children, work, school, life, or any combination. The different tools and expensive ingredients contribute to the problem of resources. And the complexity of recipes is the problem of ability. 

## Solution Statement

*How is your project going to solve the problem outlined above? Consider the competing products in your market space. What makes your solution different from other’s attempts to solve the problem? How are you able to better solve the defined problem for your audience than your competition?*

It’s a Batter Day will eliminate the time and energy required to make the mixture, the expensive ingredients and tools required, and the complexity of a recipe. Marie Calendars and Pillsbury have chilled and frozen products, but they can taste artificial and have a lot of preservatives. You also have to allow thawing of the frozen products. Bakeries have fresh products but only in the morning. By the afternoon, their products have been sitting out for hours, drying out, and losing freshness. It’s a Batter Day provides freshly made dough and batter. This eliminates the need for preservatives and thawing as the dough is fresh. It also eliminates receiving dried baked goods from a bakery. Since you bake it fresh in your oven, it will always be freshly baked. 

## Competition

*What competing products exist to solve this or a similar problem? Identify and summarize competing products and how their approach to solving your identified problem differ from your own.*

Frozen and chilled products such as pies and doughs are seen from companies like Marie Calendars and Pillsbury. Bakeries have fresh baked foods for the customer. Marie Calendar’s has frozen pies that you thaw and bake. This means they are made, frozen, packaged, and sent to a grocery store. Which is different from being made, packaged and sent to the customer. 

Pillsbury has chilled cookie doughs, biscuits, cinnamon rolls, and more. They create their products, package them, and send them to the grocery store. This is very similar to my approach without the grocery store. 

Bakeries have freshly baked items every day. They have many varieties of goods to choose from. They make the dough or batter, bake it, and then display it for the customer. This take my process a step further and bakes the item for the customer. 

## Key Features

*Define key features intended to provide solutions to specific problems and pain points you have identified. These key features should be specifically defined in response to problems / pain points. More generic features like User Authentication should not be defined here.*

Key features for It's a Batter Day include:
* Delivery scheduled for when you're home.
* Item comes ready to bake.
* Free from options.
* No nonsense preheat and bake.

## Integrations

*Identify what 3rd party APIs, data sets, or external integrations are planned for use and outline how you will use them transformatively. Provide links to their respective documentation and verify that your intended use complies with their Terms of Service.*

I honestly have no idea what 3rd party APIs, data sets, or external integrations would be used for this. I though about using the Admin API from Shopify but I am not sure if this is going to work for my application.
