## Reference Links
Use this section to highlight your own independent research. Replace the example references below with your own links and recommended resources. It is acceptable to provide multiple links for a single topic.  

I found all of the resources I researched helpful. Each one helped me understand their concepts more. "Getting Started with CSS Modules", goes over an approach to setting up CSS Modules. It need the instalation of Webpack and other dependencies to work the way the approach wanted. "Linting React" talks about how Airbnb's ESLinting rule are the most popular becuase they are simple, sensible and consistent. They rest of the article goes over setting up a project using Airbnb's ESLint rules. " Typechecking" goes over using PropTypes to define data. It discusses how this brings in a range of validation that can be used. It finalizes by talking about default props and how it sets a default property if one isn't provided.
