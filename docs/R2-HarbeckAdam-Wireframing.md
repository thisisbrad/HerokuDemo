The articles provided gave a wealth of knowledge as to why we should be wireframing and how to do it properly, which is a huge help. I also found the research I did independently to be very enlightening. Discovering the difference between a user flow and wireframe, the process of UX design, and defining a user persona will all be helpful as I build out my application for the month.
