## Reference Links
Use this section to highlight your own independent research. Replace the example references below with your own links and recommended resources. It is acceptable to provide multiple links for a single topic.  

I found that all of the resources were helpful. My research deepened my knowledge of style tiles, how to choose typography for a brand, and how to choose colors for a brand. I learned to extract adjectives from Stakeholder questionaires to learn what they want the brand to represent. Then, using these adjective, decide which fonts and colors best represent the brand.
