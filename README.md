## Progress Check / Stand Up
Each week, I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by including a **Stand-Up**. A "stand-up" is when I take the time to briefly report out on the following...

1. **Accomplishments** - What I worked on this past week
2. **Challenges** - Any challenges I may have (and how I am addressing those challenges)
3. **Next Steps** - What I plan to prioritize and do next 

<br>

**Week 1**: 

The most recent milestone I worked on was Discover & Design. In this milestone, I came up with an idea for a service, conducted user research to find my target audience, and created user personas based off of the research. I used this research to help create the wireframes and style tile, which had colors and fonts which were chosen based off of the user research.
I was able to get everyhting completed, which is an accomplishment. However, I struggled on the user research, wireframes, and style tile. I over came the struggles by pushing through. Next, I need to figure out what integrations I will have in my application and how to use them. However, I might take another look at my brand colors and possibly change them.

**Week 2**: 

This milestone I worked on planning out the documentation and aesthetics of the application. A full color, clickable, prototype was created from last weeks wireframes. I also created documentation using Apiary.
An accomplishment was that I was able to get everyhting done on time, and I was able to create an ER diagram of my application. I didn't have many challenges this week except for changing my colors. This colors were changed and the new colors were added to the prototype.

**Week 3**:    

**Week 4**:
