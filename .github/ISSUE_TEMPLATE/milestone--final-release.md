During this milestone, I will be ensuring that each element and feature of my application align with previously received feedback. 

### Final Release Internal Audit

Edit/Update this Milestone after submission of your Alpha & Beta Releases to incorporate feedback provided.

Consolidate feedback from the Alpha and Beta release milestones into a checklist here

Example:

* Dashboard
  * [ ] Exposing friend's recent posts on the dashboard will help with Oooyour overall goal of users interacting with their friends' content.
* Post creation
  * [ ] Upon creating, updating, or deletion of a post the view should visually inform the user of the success or error of such an action.
